# react-typescript-template

This project is a starter template for Typescript projects

## Usage

`npm install`
`npm start:dev`

## Some things I added

- Advanced webpack config

  - Images hosted on CDN are resolved via url at production build time
  - Images are resolved from the `media/` folder otherwise
  - SCSS compatibility
  - Font loading

- Build with TravisCI
- Deploy with surge.sh (disabled by default)
